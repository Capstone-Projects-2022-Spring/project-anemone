## P&B (Pinky and the Brain) Anemone Proposal
### An extension of your BRAIN
- An extension of your brain.
- Place to store step by step information from multiple sources
• Quotes from tutorial pages
• Code from documentation or stack overflow
- Can intelligently recommend steps or related articles based off of existing uploaded data.
• Automatic tagging/grouping suggestions
- Allows for commenting and annotation.
• Stylus input allows for highlighting and marking up content.
- User/Group permissions so that users can see just the content they need
- Similar to Kapeli “Dash” App
• Fast
• Searches entire API documentation pages
- Fast Search of large amounts of data.
- REST API so that future Applications can be developed to upload and interface with data.

### Requirement:
- The application must be modular in construction
- The interface created for the client front end (data input and retrieval) will be connected via
API and offer the opportunity for unique custom solutions to be built to address customer
requirements
- The core logic to store and retrieve data will be considered a functional module.
- The data structure/architecture will provide a flexibility to manage the acquisition of the indexable content of anything that is posted by the client. Web pages, text files, images, videos, audio, contacts... etc.
- The solution should consider scalability via cloud based implementation but also offer the ability for local system setup for private implementation.
- If possible the solution should offer a docker implementation.
- The machine learning aspect should be considered as a “module”.
- Specifically this aspect of the code should be swappable or tweakable given the user
case.
- The solution should offer a default client interface for user data collection.
- This is where a metaphor need to be considered in advance. How can data be acquired quickly and painlessly while still being robust enough to return effective/intelligent results in a context drive, possibly application aware, metaphor.
- The interfaces development should be potentially endless. platform selection, application integration, UI design, input device metaphor and coding framework.
- For the purpose of meeting a basic proof of concept the dev team should select a widget based solution such as a Dash plugin.
- There will need to be an administrator interface for the database management, access management and tokenization.
- The web based admin will be created on a pre-approved framework.

**ALL CODE CREATED FOR THIS CHALLENGE WILL BE CONSIDERED PUBLIC OPEN SOURCE.**

EBP will hold the executive admin position for maintaining the publicly accessible code repository on GIT hub and will select 2-3 managers to act as consultants and reviewers of code contributions, branch requests, project direction and project website documentation.
Client will provide local server application space and/or purchase cloud solution to the max amount of $250.00.
Potential revenue opportunities would be in the:
1. Custom Implementation and stylization for the target market or customer requirement.
2. Interface design for client interaction with the tech 2. Hosting and support
3. Machine learning optimization
4. Integration into other customer solutions.
