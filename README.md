Anemone is an application that centralizes users' documentation queries. A user will be able to search for references without leaving their current application. For unknown queries, default results will direct the user to sites like Google or Stackoverflow. The system will automatically save all query results.

Our software is primarily designed to help people who are interested in programming. The utmost intention of the software is to make it easy for people to query the web without going down rabbit holes. Users can create personal accounts through which they can store information, and log in to the same account to display historically stored information if the device is changed.
