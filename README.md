# Anemone

## Project Overview
Anemone is an application that centralizes users' documentation queries. 
A user will be able to collect and retrieve references concurrently with various active applications. 
In other words we want Anemone to coexist while a user is working in any other application.
Our software is primarily designed to help people who are interested in collecting information. 
The utmost intention of the software is to assist efficient and effective experiences for people to query personal results.

### Known Bugs
1. The `.env` file isnâ€™t being honored by the api and scraper container during deployment.
